Hugo theme Stack supports the creation of interactive image galleries using Markdown. It's powered by [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) and its syntax was inspired by [Typlog](https://typlog.com/).

A simple version of a tool to edit images by drawing onto them with the mouse cursor. Used OpenGL for the drawing aspect and the static library *pnglib* programmed by me to handle the image encoding.

<!-- ## Syntax

```markdown
![Image 1](1.jpg) ![Image 2](2.jpg)
```

## Result

![Image 1](1.jpg) ![Image 2](2.jpg)
